Here you will find the Production Software Team Roles and their required pre-requisite ***qualifications***. These roles are designed such that any role on the left can be filled by a person possessing at least one of the qualifications denoted by an "X" in the respective row.

Definition of the qualifications along the top of this table can be found in the <a href="/learning/capabilities">Qualifications</a> Section.
Definition of the capability milestones for each qualification can be found in the <a href="/learning/capabilities">Capability Milestones</a> Section.
Mechanisms for completion of these capability milestones can be found in the <a href="/learning/pathways">Learning Pathways section</a>.

***Note:*** Any developer role requires both the qualification denoted in the below table, as well as completion of the appropriate tech stack capability milestone.  For example, an Anchor Developer for a full-stack React/Express application would require the *Anchor* qualification, plus the Frontend Developer in React and Backend Developer in Express capability milestones. However, an Anchor Developer for a frontend-only React application would only need the Frontend Developer in React capability milestone in addition to the Anchor qualification.
